# TinyML-SineNet
Neural network trained in Python using TensorFlow/Keras to approximate the sine function. The modelâ€™s weights were manually extracted and embedded into an Arduino Nano 33 BLE. The neural network was fully coded in C++ on Arduino, without TensorFlow Lite, enabling real-time inference on an embedded system.
